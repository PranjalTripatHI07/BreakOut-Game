## 🔧 Customization

### 🎮 **Game Settings**

```python
# In Break_Out_game.py, modify these variables:
screen_width = 600      # Game window width
screen_height = 600     # Game window height
cols = 6               # Number of block columns
rows = 6               # Number of block rows
fps = 60               # Frames per second
```

### 🎨 **Visual Tweaks**

```python
# Particle system
particles = []         # Modify particle count and behavior

# Ball physics
self.speed_x = 4      # Horizontal ball speed
self.speed_y = -4     # Vertical ball speed
self.speed_max = 5    # Maximum ball speed
```
